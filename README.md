### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the forbes-billionaires-data to answer key questions, such as:

### Data Analysis
---
I began exploring a bunch of information about really rich people from Forbes. I wanted to understand how these rich folks got their money and where they're from.
Did some Data Cleaning and Preprocessing.
Performed EDA to explore relationships between variables, distributions, and trends in the data.
Used SQL queries to generate descriptive statistics, histograms, box plots, and other visualizations to understand the data's characteristics.
```sql
--  top industries by the total net worth of billionaires involved in each industry?
SELECT industry, SUM(`net_worth`) AS total_net_worth
FROM forbes_billionaires
GROUP BY industry
ORDER BY total_net_worth DESC;

-- How many billionaires have completed a master's degree or a doctorate?
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_of_billionaires
FROM forbes_billionaires
WHERE Master = 1 OR Doctorate = 1;
```
Interpreted the results of my analysis through reports and dashboards using Power BI.
